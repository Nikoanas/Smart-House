##How to use a photoresistor:

A photoresistor or photocell is a light-controlled variable resistor. The resistance of a photoresistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity. A photoresistor can be applied in light-sensitive detector circuits, and light- and dark-activated switching circuits. It's also called light-dependent resistor (LDR). 

For our circuit we will need: 

                             1.Arduino uno
                             2.Breadboard
                             3.LED
                             4.Photoresistror
                             5.Resistor
